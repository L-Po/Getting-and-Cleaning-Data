Variables used in the data set are as follows:

**ID** = An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (set of numbers 1-30)

**Activities** = activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors
(set of six activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

**Other variables** = 86 time and frequency domain variables comprising mean and standard deviation values 
which were normalized and bounded within [-1,1]; for each combination 
of subject and activity there was the mean value calculated for every variable
